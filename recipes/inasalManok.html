      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Inasal na manok is a unique Filipino grilled chicken dish which
        originated in Bacolod and became the signature dish of the entire
        Visayas region. It employs various chicken cuts marinated in a mixture
        of vinegar and numerous spices such as lemongrass, garlic, and ginger.
      </p>
      <p>
        During grilling, the meat is brushed with the annatto-infused oil which
        provides the chicken with an appetizing golden color and a unique
        peppery flavor. The dish is usually served alongside annatto-flavored
        garlic rice and spiced vinegar. In 2022, the city of Bacolod declared
        the dish an important cultural property.

          <strong>Marinate the Chicken</strong>: In a large bowl, combine
          calamansi juice, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, lemongrass,

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the Grill</strong>: Preheat your grill to medium-high
          heat. If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes
          to prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skewer the Chicken</strong>: (Optional) Thread the marinated
          chicken pieces onto the bamboo skewers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grill the Chicken</strong>: Place the chicken on the grill,
          skin side down. Grill for about 30-40 minutes, turning occasionally
          and basting with annatto oil. The chicken should be cooked through and
          have a nice char.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Baste Regularly</strong>: While grilling, baste the chicken
          with annatto oil to keep it moist and enhance the flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve</strong>: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill
          and let it rest for a few minutes. Serve hot with steamed rice and a
          dipping sauce of soy sauce, calamansi juice, and chili.
