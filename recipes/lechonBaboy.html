      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Lechon, derived from a Spanish word for roasted suckling pig is one of
        the most popular dishes in the Philippines. The slowly-roasted suckling
        pig is usually stuffed with lemongrass, tamarind, garlic, onions, and
        chives, and is then roasted on a large bamboo spit over an open fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is traditionally served whole on a platter, at celebrations and
        festive events such as weddings and Christmas. Once the meat is properly
        roasted and falls off the bone, people tend to eat every part of the
        pig, and the crispy, reddish-brown, crackling skin is especially
        beloved.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pork</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Lemongrass</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the Pig</strong>: Clean the pig thoroughly, removing
          the entrails and washing it inside and out with boiling water to
          remove any hair. Drain and pat dry
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Season the Pig</strong>: Rub the inside and outside of the pig
          with salt and black pepper. Stuff the pig with lemongrass, garlic,
          onions, and bay leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skewer the Pig</strong>: Skewer the pig on a long bamboo pole
          or metal rod, ensuring it is securely fastened.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Roast the Pig</strong>: Prepare a charcoal pit or large grill.
          The pig should be roasted over medium heat. Roast the pig slowly,
          turning it regularly to ensure even cooking. This process can take 4-5
          hours depending on the size of the pig. Baste the pig with a mixture
          of oil and soy sauce every 30 minutes to keep the skin crispy and
          flavorful.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check for Doneness</strong>: The pig is done when the skin is
          golden brown and crispy, and the meat is tender and juicy. You can
          check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer; it should read
          at least 160°F (71°C).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve</strong>: Carefully remove the pig from the skewer and
          let it rest for a few minutes. Carve and serve with traditional
          Filipino dipping sauces like liver sauce or vinegar with garlic and
          chili.
        </li>
